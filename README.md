Practical Experiments on how to add complete privacy to flashbots

## Overview
This repository contains snippets, ideas, etc on specific portions of the Flashbots stack that could potentially be improved via the use of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs).
So far, we have the following experiments:
- `mpc_bundle_scoring`: Computing Flashbots' bundle scoring algorithm using multiparty computation (MPC)
- `mpc_block_knapsack`: Dynamic Programming solver for block building implemented in MPC
- `mpc_knapsack_auction`: Greedy-based knapsack auction for block building implemented in MPC

## How to run

Each folder has its own run instructions depending on what PET is used and the relevant libraries.
